My name is Fabian, I am a fourth year PhD student in computational physics.
I am working on machine-learned interatomic potentials, with a focus on ionic liquids.
Besides that, I have ventured into developing a fullstack 3D application for looking at molecular structures, editing them and modifying them. The application is written in Python with a flask / socketio backend and a typescript / react / threejs frontend.

Furthermore, I have worked on MLPX, for evaluating foundation MLIPs on certain real-world applications.
This was a project during an internship, but I continue to work on it and hope to add new features periodically.
Currently, I am working on enhanced sampling methods, e.g. running metadynamics on alanine dipeptide to compare different MLIPs and how well they perform!
